 BURUNDI: REBEL AMBUSH -- Twenty-seven soldiers and five civilians were killed over the weekend in a rebel ambush near Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, casting a shadow over peace talks reconvening in Arusha, Tanzania. Most of the dead were officer cadets from the Higher Institute of Military Staff returning from a sporting event, military sources said. The West Africans will be trained as light infantry, ready to ''get off the roads and into the bush,'' the Pentagon official said.
