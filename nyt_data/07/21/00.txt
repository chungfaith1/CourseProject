The Civil War era has never looked quite the way it does in Ang Lee's chilly, dramatically skimpy epic about a group of pro-Southern bushwhackers waging war along the Kansas-Missouri border. Far from ''Gone With the Wind,'' austere farmhouses and primitive frontier towns are better suited to an anthropological study. The story focuses on two of the bushwhackers (Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich) and leads to a stunning re-creation of the guerrilla raid on Lawrence, Kan., led by William Clarke Quantrill, but the meditative quality and attention to detail ''keep the story at a distance'' (Stephen Holden).
