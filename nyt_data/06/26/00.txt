In recent months, the rebels in Chechen have mounted guerrilla ambushes, suicide bombings and snipers. The rebels have also infiltrated Grozny, the Chechen capital, and other towns, and are drawing support from the Chechen population. In recent months, a series of bloody ambushes has led Russian troops to hunker down and adopt a largely defensive posture.
