 Bob Green, a senior instructor at Skip Barber Racing School in Lakeville, Conn., said the problem was that untrained drivers used antilock brakes incorrectly. Jam on the brakes and cause a skid in an old car, he said, and the car will go straight no matter how you turn the wheel; do the same with antilock brakes, and the car will turn the way the front wheels are pointed. That may lead to some cars ''vaulting off into the bushes,'' he said. ''Footloose'' opened in October 1998 at an estimated cost of $6.5 million and to a bushel of poor notices,  with a few good ones mixed in. Still, producers pushed ahead, and their effort was not without precedent. In recent years, after all, shows like ''Annie Get Your Gun'' and ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'' have overcome negative reviews to build audiences with newfangled demographic direct mail and old-fashioned advertising blitzes. For ''Footloose,'' producers aimed at suburban radio outlets and newspapers, hoping to tap into fans of the musical's source material, the hit 1984 film that starred Kevin Bacon.
