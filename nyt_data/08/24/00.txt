 The showman in Mr. Robinson longs to see his music make it to Broadway, with star-quality performers and perhaps a technologically dazzling burning bush. He has the ear of major black dance and theater companies who may help it get there, he said. In 1998 he received  a grant for $35,000 from Steven Spielberg's Righteous Persons Foundation and in December 1999, a matching grant from that organization for $50,000. In a case like Sierra Leone, where 500 ill-trained peacekeepers walked into ambushes in May, Secretary General Annan was left begging for military expertise -- finally provided by the British -- because the peacekeeping department did not have the people to do the job itself and did not have a roster of ready professionals on loan from governments to call on. Residents of the 43rd Assembly District, which includes the Crown Heights and East Flatbush sections of Brooklyn, have had several opportunities to know Mr. Davis. Apart from his campaign against Mr. Norman in 1998, Mr. Davis ran an unsuccessful campaign in the Democratic primary against City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett in 1997. And in 1996, he failed to get a spot on the ballot in a primary campaign against Representative Major Owens.
