Bumpkin Island has a fancy-looking pier, but the park managers had said it was not open yet, and there was no one else on the island but a motorboating family. From the pier, a concrete path lined by salt-spray rose bushes (who, you wonder, lugged all that concrete here?) leads off around the island and up to the ruins of a children's hospital that burned down in 1945, its roofless pillars now swamped in a jungle of trees. It seems a pity to tell you that, though; so much of the fun comes from following a path without knowing where it leads.

There are only two possibilities: the burning bush or the other burning place.''
