Ms. Harron's sleekly brilliant screen adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's notorious 1991 novel pares away most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire, comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Mr. Bale as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-80's Wall Street hotshot who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's message about a soulless, surface-obsessed society still applies (Stephen Holden). * ''AMERICAN PSYCHO,'' starring Christian Bale. Directed by Mary Harron (R, 104 minutes).

RUSSIA: AMBUSH REPORTED -- The Russian military said its special forces ambushed and killed at least 18 Chechen rebels southeast of Grozny. The report could not be confirmed, but if true it could signal a shift in Russian tactics. Russians have relied on armor and air power to press their assault; ambushes have been the rebels' most successful tactic. Legally, describing the terror and gore might have been skipped, because the defense does not dispute that the plane crashed and people died. LUKA-Darda Falasha Conrad Yaacov. On May 2, 2000.
