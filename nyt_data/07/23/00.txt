 ''It was sandy soil and had to be cleared of dense forest,'' said Rachel Rodgers, the executive director of the Cape May County division of culture and heritage. ''It was full of mosquitoes and scrub bushes, horrible conditions for agriculture. So the factories did a lot better.'' The north side of Fenimore Street, from Flatbush to Rogers Avenues, was the lower edge of an eight-square-block area sold off by the Lefferts family in the 1890's. Their 18th-century homestead originally stood at Midwood Street and Flatbush Avenue but is now just inside the boundary of Prospect Park. The first developers put up tightly packed row houses. But when the land at 241, 245 and 249 Fenimore Street came up, the developer Henry Terboss built more suburban-style wooden houses, completed in 1909.
