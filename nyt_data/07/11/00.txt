 Wells has a head that is balder than Mr. Clean and a scraggly goatee that looks like a thorn bush. He wears a uniform jersey that could serve as a tent for a few toddlers and pants that are baggy enough to hold watermelons.

''We wouldn't call it a mountain in Tennessee, but anyway the Viet Cong controlled it at night and the United States during the day and my buddy and I stayed there and lived in a tent. We took comfort from the fact that ambushes were rare, but still, it was, 'O.K., how rare?' ''
