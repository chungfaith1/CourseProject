 Next to the blue door with the small white-on-black sign ''Tom Morris Ltd. registered office'' is a life-size wooden cutout of Old Tom himself: tweed cap, bushy beard, green suit, holding a baffy. Every so often, a visitor stops and poses next to that cutout for a snapshot. EIDINGER-Mildred, on July 16th. Devoted wife of the late Abe.

From once relying on teenage suicide bombers to crash cars into Israeli installations in the mid-1980's, Hezbollah tactics -- primarily ambushes, assassinations and roadside bombs -- became increasingly well planned and executed, military observers in the region say. A turning point came three years ago this month with the ambush of a raid by elite Israeli naval commandos in which a dozen were killed. The Israelis halted such raids for more than a year, trying to find out what went wrong, and then Hezbollah put out word that it had penetrated Israeli intelligence, the sheik and Western military observers said, further halting Israeli counterinsurgency operations. The effect was to  drive the Israelis into bunkers, conceding land and initiative to Hezbollah.
