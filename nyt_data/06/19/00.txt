 In Jewish genealogies, the story of the son always begins with the father. It grounds him, explains him. And it is the same with the Judah family. At 13, Yoel embraced a century-old hybrid of Christianity, Judaism and black nationalism, and today he and his sons call themselves Israelites, or Black Jews. The movement is informal and varied, and some branches of the Israelites have even been accepted by Reform Judaism. The Judahs do not belong to a formal congregation. Instead, they huddle in their East Flatbush home in the evenings or on weekends to hear Yoel tell them about the men of God. King Solomon is a favorite.
