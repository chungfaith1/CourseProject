 Dr. William K. Kopp was reared in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and when he visited his son and daughter-in-law's new apartment in Brooklyn Heights, he realized it was only a block from the Hotel St. George and its huge indoor pool, where he occasionally swam as a child. The proximity  brought to mind a lesson he had learned in 1950 as an 11-year-old. After swimming and dressing he was waiting for friends to take the subway home when an older boy approached, pointed a knife at him and said he needed money for his sick mother. The boy added he hated to do this but his mother needed medicine badly. If his victim came back in two weeks, though, he would pay him back.
