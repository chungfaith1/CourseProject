 Palestinian Authority is running summer camps for 25,000 teenaged boys to teach them arts of kidnapping, ambushing and using assault weapons; mood at camps is throwback to days before Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat joined Israeli leaders in peacemaking effort that faltered last week at Camp David; map; photos (M) In the summer of the latest Camp David talks, a summer that was supposed to produce a final peace settlement between Israel and its Palestinian adversaries, the Palestinians' idea of a teenage boys' camp is a reminder of how deep old enmities run. At 90 two- and three-week camps on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, youths from towns and villages already ceded to Israel by Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority are learning the arts of kidnapping, ambushing and using assault weapons. Mike Wallace, an accountant, said he left New York University in Greenwich Village at 4 p.m. for a commute to East Flatbush that usually takes him 45 minutes. He took the 6 train to the Brooklyn Bridge stop, where he could not get on the 4, so he took the M to Court Street in Brooklyn and then the N to Pacific Street and got out to try to find a B45 bus. According to his statement, investigators said, he and the two other men were sitting in a luncheonette on the southeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Park Place when they saw Ms. Watkins walk by laden with shopping bags and decided she would be ''an easy mark.''
