 Mandrills in Lope Reserve of Gabon are observed living in large groups, some numbering over a thousand, and these groups are made up almost entirely of females and their dependent offspring; males move into the group at beginning of a breeding season and disappear once it is through; their battles for mates are fierce and punishing, and their remarkable coloration may be a way of minimizing violence; scientists are concerned that mandrills will increasingly fall prey to bush meat trade as logging roads open deep forests; photos; map; drawing (M) On a more somber note, the discoveries raise questions about the species' long-term prospects as a free-ranging creature. Conservationists are alarmed by how the recent rise in the so-called bush meat trade -- the hunting of wild animals in general and primates in particular -- might affect mandrill populations. Because the new studies show that mandrills travel over unusually long distances in spectacularly large numbers, conservationists are concerned that the monkeys will be especially vulnerable to hunters using the ever-expanding network of logging roads to penetrate into forests that were once inaccessible to hunting. Some conservation organizations now rank the bush meat trade as the single greatest threat to primates and other wildlife, outstripping in severity even the familiar eco-villain, habitat loss. This and another study in Sweden ''suggest that the amount of exercise needed to achieve a cardioprotective benefit is modest,'' said Dr. Charles M. Clark Jr. of the Richard Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Indianapolis. A third estimate, from Dr. John Quackenbush and colleagues at the Institute for Genomic Research, also based on gene transcripts, puts the number of genes at about 120,000. For the record, Dr. Green's bet on the number of human genes is 35,000. Dr. Quackenbush's is 118,259.
