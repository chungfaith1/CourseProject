 Bright yellow Hezbollah flags flew over all the old South Lebanon Army and Israeli strongholds and gun positions, but there was no sign in the streets of armed militiamen or the once-common checkpoints. In the last few days, new yellow roadside signs have sprouted, marking places where Israeli patrols were ambushed by Hezbollah, or where the Islamic militia lost some of the 1,200 resistance ''martyrs,'' as it calls the fighters killed doing battle here. Court papers say that Mr. Fainberg, who moved from Brooklyn to Florida in 1989, ran a remarkably eclectic criminal empire out of two businesses he owned in Miami: a strip club near Miami International Airport called Porky's and a borscht-and-blini restaurant in North Miami Beach called Babushka. Weeks after the partners were reunited, the government sprang its Brooklyn-based trap. Mr. Roizis was instructed to hang out in Babushka, and on the appointed night, Mr. Yasevich walked in. Then, the government says, as Mr. Fainberg watched, the two men greeted each other in mock surprise. They bear-hugged, speaking Russian, and loudly reminisced about Brighton Beach. Mr. Fainberg fell for the act completely.
