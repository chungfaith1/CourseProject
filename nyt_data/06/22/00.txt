 ALBANY: DAMAGED APPLE CROP -- Hudson Valley apple growers say they will need federal aid because hailstorms on May 18 and June 2 damaged an estimated two million bushels of apples. Apples are the fourth most valuable crop in the state, generating $138 million in 1999. Loss estimates for the mid-Hudson alone run as high as $10 million. On Monday, Agriculture Commissioner Nathan L. Rudgers toured apple orchards to view the damage and heard from growers, some of whom said their economic survival was at stake. DENNER-Ethel.
